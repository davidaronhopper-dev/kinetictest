# Full Stack Developer - Assessment
Start by pulling down a copy of the repo we've shared with you. We will be requiring you to keep track of your changes in Git and publicly publishing your repo when you're ready. As far as publishing, you may use any git hosting service you would like, GitHub, BitBucket, GitLab, etc.

Please create a new file for each project below (name examples: project_01.php, project_one.js, proj_1.py, etc.).

## Project 01 - FizzBuzz

Write a short program that prints each number from 1 to 100 on a new line. 

For each multiple of 3, print "Fizz" instead of the number. 

For each multiple of 5, print "Buzz" instead of the number. 

For numbers which are multiples of both 3 and 5, print "FizzBuzz" instead of the number.

You may write your program in either PHP, Javascript or Python.

## Project 02 - PHP Mini Project
This project should be completed in PHP, what verion of PHP is up to you, but please add a comment at the top of the file with the version number (i.e. "PHP Version: 7.4") so we know what enviroment to run your code in.

The scenario: The client has a store front that needs a back-end API. Create a simple PHP class to handle adding, subtracting and changing quantities of items in the cart. You'll find the request parameters below for each API call from the front-end, each request will provide all the required data needed to perform the request on the back-end. We're going to assume front-to-backend security headers are taken care via magic for the sake of time :). When it comes to storing the data, we obviously need a place to store it, to again make this straight-forward and simple, we've created a simple database structure and included it in this repo. This database is ULTRA simple and is really just a place to store the data, feel free to alter it if you see neccessary. Don't worry about user -> cart relationships, here, again for simplicity, we're assuming carts = users.
