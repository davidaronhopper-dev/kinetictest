# Full Stack Developer - Assessment
Start by pulling down a copy of the repo we've shared with you. We will be requiring you to keep track of your changes in Git and publicly publishing your repo when you're ready. As far as publishing, you may use any git hosting service you would like, GitHub, BitBucket, GitLab, etc.

Please create a new file for each project below (name examples: project_01.php, project_one.js, proj_1.py, etc.).

## Project 01 - FizzBuzz

Write a short program that prints each number from 1 to 100 on a new line. 

- For each multiple of 3, print "Fizz" instead of the number. 
- For each multiple of 5, print "Buzz" instead of the number. \
- For numbers which are multiples of both 3 and 5, print "FizzBuzz" instead of the number.

You may write your program in either PHP, Javascript or Python.

## Project 02 - PHP Mini Project
This project should be completed in PHP, what verion of PHP is up to you, but please add a comment at the top of the file with the version number (i.e. "PHP Version: 7.4") if you use any in-built functions or methods. 

The scenario: The client has a store front that needs a back-end API. Using the Cart class in the project_02.php included in the repo, create the methods to

- handle adding items, removing items, updating item quantities and clearing all items from the cart, then return the updated cart. 
- calculate and return the total of all the items in the cart with tax applied

You'll find the required variables and data in the project_02.php file. We're going to assume front-to-backend security headers and input sanitization are taken care via magic for the sake of time :). This project does not need to have a local server setup or a database connected. We are primarily looking for the general CRUD operations to be built.

## Project 03 - JavaScript Mini Project
Please run through each of the following items using only vanilla JavaScript. While you're more than welcome to split these out into their own files, you can also put them all into a "project_03.js" file and use comments to seperate / label them.

1. Explain what a callback function is and provide a simple code example of one. The explanation should be included in the file as a comment.
2. Give two arrays, a "Working" array and a "Deleted" array, write functions to add and subtract items from the "working" array while also keeping track of the "deleted" items in the "Deleted" array. You may also work with objects instead of arrays.
3. Write a function to check if two strings are anagrams of one another.


## That's It!
When you're done, please publish your repo either on GitHub, GitLab, BitBucket or another publicly available git repo hosting service of your choosing and email it to both (CC'ing one of us is fine, no need for seperate emails) michael@kinetic.com and steven@kinetic.com. If you could also tell us what you thought overall of this assesment in your email, that would also be helpful. We're constantly trying to improve our processes and feedback is always welcome!
